# Playnite-Theme---Default-With-Detail-Bar
Updated the default 5.0 skin to add details onto it's own bar on the right, and reduce the gap at the top.


1. Find the directory "C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Playnite\Themes".
2. Add the contents of the git as a folder along with the folders here.
3. Go to Playnite, press F4, go to appearance. The theme should be found in the first drop down. If not, restart playnite.
